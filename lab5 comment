# CISC-3140
My log files are corrupted and I try google it for hours but could not find anyway to solve it.
The first part was a CSV for game length of one-player version of Snakes and Ladders, I get the column with the game length and sort them.
The second part I use nano to write the shell script.
I run in to some problems in the last part of the lab and couldn't solve it in time.
